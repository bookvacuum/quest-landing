This is Quit Now, built at EthSF 2022. 
It uses a few key things:
1) Triangle Library for wallet abstraction for users who dont have wallets already
2) Push Protocol Library for push notifications
3) Solidity for the smart contract to hold tokens that are sent to the owner of the contract 

It's a way you can support your friends, and also earn money if you hate your job. OR just think about living.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
